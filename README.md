This is a repository with my 2 programs, that is used to monitor the readings of amps, frequency and watts passing through a meter. Program 1 displays the readings every second and automatically stores them in a database. The user can either automatically export all the data to a connected USB, or delete all the data. The second program is loaded onto the employees' personal computer, and automatically displays all the data in the database if the USB (on which the data was exported to) is connected.
